# Conway_Game_Of_Life
Java Application with GUI simulating Conway's Game of Life, Using Java Swing as an interface. 
After running the application the user can select any orientation of black tiles to act as living cells by clicking the white buttons. 
Once the User is ready, they can continuously click the "next" button to simulate the next successor generation in accordance to Conway's rules.

### Conway's rules

* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
* Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
* All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

# What I Learned

* How to separate Model, View, and Controller in MVC Architecture
* Using ArrayLists to represent generations on a 2 demetional grid structure
